* Ideas

** graphics

- use quil for N fps rendering
- use quil for on-change rendering
- based on the plate, build a static image and then use the choosen renderer
  to display the pre-built image
  - dump plate to log for debug purpose
  - build the image
  - render
- make own graphic output

** input

- use quil
- use other lib
- build own input

** ensure the next move is ready

- fixed choice: first of available colors
- random choice from available colors
- greedy choice: max of available colors
- calculated choice based on the plate analysis

* Steps during the run (big picture)

1. preparation
   - build plate
   - build graph from plate
2. work
   - show current plate/graph
   - for every input
     - get input
     - update plate/graph
     - show current plate/graph
     - check finish
